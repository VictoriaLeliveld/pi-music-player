Pi Music Player is a lightweight web-based music player I built to run on my Raspberry Pi 3. The app lets you play, pause, skip, and go back through songs with a clean, minimal interface. It was a fun way to combine front-end design with Python back-end development, and to explore hosting a web app on a Raspberry Pi.

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/VictoriaLeliveld/pi-music-player.git`
